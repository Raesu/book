## The Basic Idea {#sec-potential}

![Potential outcome](img/potential.jpg){.lightbox}

The potential outcomes framework, also known as the Rubin Causal Model, provides
a formal mathematical approach to defining and estimating causal effects. This
framework, developed by Donald Rubin building on work by Jerzy Neyman, is
central to modern causal inference and has become increasingly important in
business data science. At its core, the potential outcomes framework posits that
each unit (e.g., person, company, product) has a set of potential outcomes
corresponding to each possible treatment condition. For instance:

1. A tech company testing a new app interface might consider:
    - $Y(1)$: user engagement if exposed to the new interface 
    - $Y(0)$: user engagement if exposed to the old interface
2. An e-commerce platform implementing a recommendation system might examine:
    - $Y(1)$: customer purchase amount with personalized recommendations
    - $Y(0)$: customer purchase amount without personalized recommendations
3. A SaaS company offering a free trial could look at:
    - $Y(1)$: conversion rate if offered a 30-day free trial 
    - $Y(0)$: conversion rate if not offered a free trial

The causal effect for an individual is then defined as the difference between
these potential outcomes: $Y(1) - Y(0)$. However, we face what
@holland1986statistics termed the "fundamental problem of causal inference" - we
can only observe one of these potential outcomes for each unit. If a customer is
exposed to the new interface, we observe $Y(1)$ but $Y(0)$ remains unobserved
(and vice versa). This makes causal inference inherently a missing data problem,
a concept we'll explore further later in this chapter.

## Key Concepts and Estimands

Several important concepts and estimands are central to the potential outcomes
framework. The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is the average causal effect
across the entire population, defined as $E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$. This gives us an
overall measure of the treatment's impact.

When we're interested in how the treatment effect varies across different
subgroups, we look at the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). This is
defined as $E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X]$, where X represents a specific set of
covariates. CATE allows us to understand how the treatment effect might differ
for various segments of our population.

Sometimes, we're particularly interested in the effect on those who actually
received the treatment. This is captured by the Average Treatment Effect on the
Treated (ATT), defined as $E[Y(1) - Y(0) | W = 1]$, where W is the treatment
indicator. In certain scenarios, such as when using instrumental variables, we
might focus on the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE), which represents the
average treatment effect for a specific subpopulation of compliers.

A crucial assumption in many causal analyses is **ignorability**. This assumes
that treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes given
observed covariates. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
$(Y(1), Y(0)) ⊥ W | X$ where $W$ is the treatment assignment and $X$ are the
observed covariates. For instance, in our e-commerce recommendation system
example, ignorability would mean that whether a customer sees personalized
recommendations (W) is independent of how much they would potentially purchase
with or without recommendations ($Y(1), Y(0)$), once we account for observed
factors like browsing history, past purchases, etc. ($X$).

## Experimental vs Observational Studies

The potential outcomes framework can be applied to both experimental and
observational studies, each with its own strengths and challenges:

**Experimental Studies:** In randomized controlled trials, treatment assignment
is controlled by the researcher. This control ensures that the ignorability
assumption holds by design. For example, when A/B testing a new website design,
the randomization of which users see which version ensures that potential
outcomes are independent of the assignment. This makes causal inference more
straightforward but may not always be feasible in business settings due to
ethical, practical, or cost constraints.

**Observational Studies:** These are more common in business contexts but
present more challenges. For instance, if we want to study the effect of a
loyalty program on customer retention, customers typically choose whether to
join the program rather than being randomly assigned. In these cases, we need to
carefully consider and account for potential confounders to approximate the
conditions of an experiment. This often involves sophisticated statistical
techniques to adjust for differences between the treatment and control groups,
such as propensity score matching or inverse probability weighting.

## Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

In business applications, it's crucial to consider that the effect of an
intervention might vary across different subgroups of customers or products.
This heterogeneity can be masked when looking only at average effects. For
example:

  - A new marketing strategy might have a positive effect on one customer
    segment but a negative effect on another.
  - A product feature might significantly boost engagement for power users but
    have minimal impact on casual users.

Understanding these heterogeneous effects can lead to more targeted and
effective business strategies, such as personalized marketing campaigns or
tailored product features.

## Selection Bias

Selection bias occurs when the individuals who select into the treatment group
differ systematically from those who do not. In business contexts, this is a
common issue. For example:

  - Customers who choose to use a new feature might be systematically different
    from those who don't, making it challenging to isolate the true effect of
    the feature on outcomes like engagement or sales.
  - Early adopters of a product might have different characteristics and
    behaviors compared to later adopters, potentially skewing our understanding
    of the product's impact.

Recognizing and addressing selection bias is crucial for making valid causal
inferences in business settings.

## Connections to Missing Data

The link between causal inference and missing data is profound. In the potential
outcomes framework, we're always missing at least one potential outcome for each
unit. This is similar to the problem of missing data in surveys or experiments
where some values are unobserved.

Methods developed for handling missing data have direct analogues in causal
inference. For example, multiple imputation techniques can be adapted to impute
missing potential outcomes. Inverse probability weighting, commonly used in
missing data problems, is analogous to propensity score weighting in causal
inference.

The assumptions underlying missing data methods also have parallels in causal
inference. The assumption of "Missing At Random" (MAR) in missing data
literature is similar to the ignorability assumption in causal inference. Both
assume that the missingness (or treatment assignment) is independent of the
unobserved data, given the observed data.

Understanding these connections can provide valuable insights and tools for
addressing the inherent missing data problem in causal inference. By leveraging
techniques from both fields, researchers can develop more robust methods for
estimating causal effects in a variety of real-world scenarios.

## Conclusion

The potential outcomes framework provides a powerful tool for business data
scientists to approach causal questions rigorously. By understanding the
fundamental concepts, key estimands, and challenges associated with this
framework, data scientists can make more informed decisions about experimental
design, analysis methods, and interpretation of results. As we delve deeper into
specific techniques and applications in the following chapters, keep these
foundational ideas in mind – they will serve as the bedrock for more advanced
causal inference methods in business contexts.
