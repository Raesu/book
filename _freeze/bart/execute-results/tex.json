It can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nY = \\sum_{j=1}^m g(X; T_j, M_j) + \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\n$$\n\nwhere $g(X; T_j, M_j)$ represents the $j$-th regression tree with structure\n$T_j$ and leaf node parameters $M_j$. The model uses $m$ trees, typically set to\na large number (e.g., 200), with each tree acting as a weak learner. BART\nemploys a carefully designed prior that encourages each tree to play a small\nrole in the overall fit, resulting in a flexible yet robust model.\n\n@hill2011bayesian proposed using BART for causal inference, recognizing that its\nflexibility in modeling complex response surfaces made it well-suited for\nestimating causal effects, particularly in observational studies with many\ncovariates. The key idea was to use BART to model the response surface:\n\n$$\nE[Y | X, Z] = f(X, Z)\n$$\n\nwhere $Y$ is the outcome, $X$ are the covariates, and $Z$ is the treatment\nindicator. The causal effect can then be estimated as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tau(x) & = E[Y | X=x, Z=1] - E[Y | X=x, Z=0] \\\\\n & = f(x, 1) - f(x, 0)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis formulation leverages BART's inherent ability to automatically capture\nintricate interactions and non-linear relationships, making it a potent tool for\ncausal inference, especially in high-dimensional scenarios.\n\nThe effectiveness of BART in causal inference has been further validated in\nrecent competitions. @thal2023causal report on the 2022 American Causal\nInference Conference (ACIC) data challenge, where BART-based methods were among\nthe top performers, particularly for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.\nThey found that BART's regularizing priors were especially effective in\ncontrolling error for subgroup estimates, even in small subgroups, and its\nflexibility in modeling confounding relationships was crucial for improved\ncausal inference in complex scenarios.\n\n## Example with a Single Covariate\n\nTo illustrate how BART can be used for estimating the impact of an intervention,\n@hill2011bayesian presents a simple example:\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nZ &\\sim \\mbox{Bernoulli}(0.5) \\\\\nX | Z = 1 &\\sim N(40,10^2) \\\\\nX | Z = 0 &\\sim N(20,10^2) \\\\\nY(0) | X &\\sim N(72 + 3\\sqrt{X},1) \\\\\nY(1) | X &\\sim N(90 + exp(0.06X),1) \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom) \n\n# 1.

However, it's important to exercise caution when interpreting the results\nof CART. CART models do not inherently account for uncertainty, and therefore,\ntheir splits might not always reveal characteristics that genuinely\ndifferentiate subgroups with meaningfully distinct impacts. In other words,\nwhile CART pinpointed $x_3$ as the key modifier, it also says that $x_1$ is a\nmodifier, and we know that is not correct.\n\nTo delve deeper into the question of whether the impacts truly vary based on a\nparticular characteristic, we can leverage the posterior draws obtained from the\nfitted BART model. These draws offer a richer representation of the uncertainty\nsurrounding the estimated treatment effects, enabling us to conduct more robust\nanalyses regarding heterogeneity. Remember, it's crucial to avoid\noverinterpreting the CART results and to explore the full posterior distribution\nfor a more nuanced understanding of the causal relationships in our data.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Learn more\n@hill2011bayesian Bayesian nonparametric modeling for causal inference.\n::: \n\n## Accelerated BART (XBART)\n\nTODO",
