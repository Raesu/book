For example, instead of waiting to see\nhow a new feature impacts annual revenue, we might look at its effect on daily\nactive users or click-through rates. By understanding the relationship between\nthese short-term surrogates and the long-term outcome, we can gain insights into\nhow our actions are likely to impact the metrics we truly care about.\n\n### Importance of Surrogates\n\nIn many cases, a single surrogate may not fully capture the complexity of the\nlong-term outcome. This is where the concept of a surrogate index comes in. By\ncombining multiple surrogates into a single metric, we can create a more\ncomprehensive and nuanced picture of the impact of our decisions. For example,\nwe might combine metrics like user engagement, satisfaction ratings, and\nretention rates into a single index that reflects the overall health of our\nproduct.\n\n### Validity of Surrogate Studies\n\nTo ensure the validity of a surrogate study, two key ingredients are essential:\n\n  - Validity of Surrogates: The surrogates must be valid, meaning that the\n    policy or decision we are interested in truly affects the ultimate outcome\n    through the chosen surrogates.\n  - Robust Identification: We need to robustly identify the policy's effects on\n    the surrogates. This is often achieved through randomized experiments, but\n    other methods can also be used.\n\nThe tech sector is awash in data, offering a wide range of potential surrogates.\nThese might include metrics like website traffic, click-through rates, user\nengagement, social media mentions, and app downloads. The specific surrogates to\nchoose will depend on the nature of the decision being studied and the available\ndata.\n\n### Choosing the Right Surrogates\n\nSelecting appropriate surrogates requires a deep understanding of the domain and\nthe long-term outcomes of interest. It's crucial to choose surrogates that are\nclosely linked to these outcomes. For example:\n\n  - **E-commerce:** For an online store, short-term surrogates might include cart\n    abandonment rates, average order value, and customer reviews.\n  - **Healthcare:** In a clinical trial, blood pressure and cholesterol levels can\n    be surrogates for long-term cardiovascular health.\n\n## Estimating Effects in Practice\nThere are several ways to estimate long-term effects using a surrogate index.\nThe simplest approach is to use an experimental setup, where we know the\nprobability of a unit being assigned to a particular group. In this case, we can\nestimate the surrogate index and then use it to impute the long-term outcome.\n\n### Methods for Estimating Surrogacy\n\nThe method used to estimate the surrogacy index is flexible, as long as it\ncaptures the average effect of the index on the long-term outcome. In scenarios\nwith many potential surrogates, techniques like LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage\nand Selection Operator) can be used to identify the most relevant ones. Other\nmachine learning techniques such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting can also\nbe employed to handle complex, high-dimensional data.\n\n\n### Practical Example\n\nTo illustrate the application of surrogate indices, consider a tech company\nrunning an A/B test to evaluate a new feature. The company might track several\nmetrics during the experiment, such as user engagement, time spent on the\nplatform, and frequency of feature usage. By combining these metrics into a\nsurrogate index, the company can predict the feature's impact on long-term user\nretention and revenue growth.\n\n#### Example with Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# TODO WRITE EXAMPLE!\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSurrogates are powerful tools that can help bridge the gap between short-term\nmetrics and long-term outcomes. By carefully selecting and validating\nsurrogates, and employing robust estimation methods, we can make more informed\ndecisions and predict the long-term impact of our actions with greater\nprecision.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Learn more\n  - @athey2019surrogate The surrogate index: Combining short-term proxies to\n    estimate long-term treatment effects more rapidly and precisely.\n  - @imbens2022long Long-term causal inference under persistent confounding via\n    data combination.\n  - @chen2023semiparametric Semiparametric estimation of long-term treatment\n    effects.\n  - @zhang2023evaluating Evaluating the Surrogate Index as a Decision-Making\n    Tool Using 200 A/B Tests at Netflix.\n:::",
