In today's tech-driven world, data is king. Every click, swipe, and search
generates a breadcrumb of information. Alas, although most decision-makers want
to be `r glossary("data-driven")`, data does not speak for itself.

So, what does it mean to be `r glossary("data-driven")`? At its core, it's about
using data to inform decisions, not just describe them. It's about moving beyond
`r glossary("Correlation", "correlation")` – the "what goes with what" – and
understanding causation, the "why" behind the patterns we see. To be truly
`r glossary("data-driven")`, there must be some level of evidence that the data
can provide that would make you choose a different path than the one you would
have otherwise taken.

This is where `r glossary("causal inference")` steps in.
`r glossary("Causal inference")` is the science of drawing cause-and-effect
conclusions from data. It allows us to answer questions like:

  - Did a new marketing campaign actually drive sales, or was it launched during
    a time when sales naturally increase?
  - Will a new app feature increase user engagement, or will it just annoy
    users?
  - Is a chatbot the best way to reduce wait time and increase customer
    satisfaction?

`r glossary("Causal inference")` is the missing piece of the
`r glossary("data-driven")` puzzle. It lets us move beyond
`r glossary("Correlation", "correlation")` and identify the true drivers of
business outcomes. `r glossary("Impact evaluation")` builds on this, putting
numbers to the effects of a program, policy, or intervention. Think of it as
measuring the impact of a specific business decision.

Data can also be used to improve the ongoing operations and effectiveness of a
program, a process known as
`r glossary("Program Improvement", "program improvement")`. This involves
continuously collecting data on how the program is running, identifying any
bottlenecks or areas for enhancement, and making adjustments as needed. Think of
program improvement as an ongoing feedback loop, constantly refining and
optimizing the program based on real-world data.

Now, let's delve a bit deeper. Imagine you're a decision-maker at a social media
company pondering a new feature. You have data showing that users who engage
with the feature spend more time on the platform. This is a
`r glossary("Correlation", "correlation")`, but it doesn't tell the whole story.
What if those users were already naturally the most engaged?

This is where the concept of the counterfactual becomes crucial. The
counterfactual is what would have happened if we hadn't implemented the new
feature – it's the `r glossary("potential outcome")` had we not made the change.
While Jerzy Neyman hinted at this idea in 1923 [see @neyman1923applications],
Donald Rubin fully developed the concept in the 1970s [see
@rubin1974estimating; also @rubin1978bayesian] . Given that we can only observe
one potential outcome for each unit, the counterfactual is inherently missing
data. Hence, causal inference can be viewed as a missing data problem. For a
review of variety of causal inference methods from this perspective see
@ding2018causal.

Choosing the right counterfactual is critical for drawing valid causal
conclusions. The wrong counterfactual can lead to misleading results and
potentially disastrous business decisions. We'll explore these challenges and
different approaches to constructing counterfactuals in the coming chapters.

By understanding `r glossary("causal inference")` and the importance of
counterfactuals, you'll be well on your way to leveraging the true power of data
to make informed decisions for your business. However, choosing the wrong
counterfactual can have serious consequences. Here are some classic examples:

  - *Before-and-After Studies:* Imagine evaluating a job training program by
    comparing participants' income before and after participation. What if the
    economy was improving during that time, and their income would have
    increased anyway? A simple before-and-after comparison can't account for
    these external factors.

  - *Self-Selection Bias:* Suppose you want to assess the effect of a new
    exercise app. You compare those who chose to use the app to those who
    didn't. What if people who downloaded the app were already more motivated to
    exercise? This self-selection bias can skew the results, making the app look
    more effective than it truly is.

Remember, in order to design a good study to inform decisions, we need to know
which decisions we are trying to inform. This clarity about the decision at hand
allows us to choose the right counterfactual scenario for comparison. By
carefully considering `r glossary("potential outcome", "potential outcomes")`
and constructing strong counterfactuals, we can leverage the power of data to
make informed choices and drive better business results.
