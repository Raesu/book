title: "The Gold Standard"
---

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have a rich history, dating back to
the 1920s when researchers used them to compare crop yields under different
conditions. In medicine, RCTs gained prominence in the mid-20th century, thanks
to pioneers like Austin Bradford Hill, who demonstrated their power in
evaluating the effectiveness of treatments like streptomycin for tuberculosis.
Today, RCTs are considered the gold standard for establishing causality in many
fields, from healthcare to social policy.

In the tech sector, a simplified version of the RCT – the A/B test – has become
ubiquitous. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook routinely run A/B tests
to evaluate new features, website designs, and marketing campaigns. The allure
of A/B testing lies in its simplicity: randomly assign users to different
groups, expose them to different versions of a product or experience, and
measure the outcomes. This allows for a clean comparison, isolating the effect
of the change from other factors that might influence user behavior.
